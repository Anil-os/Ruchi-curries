## Step-by-Step Instructions:

### 1. Open Your Figma Design
Go to: https://www.figma.com/design/eOFfNX0jIuF4ztYiL8mlWt/Ruchi-curries

### 2. Export Each Image Layer

**Required Images (9 total):**

#### Logo:
- Select the "Ruchi" logo layer
- Right panel → Export section
- Format: PNG
- Click "Export"
- Save as: `ruchi-removebg-preview-1.png`

#### Bottom Images (Small food items):
- Select Biryani small image → Export as `biriyani-removebg-preview-2.png`
- Select Kebab small image → Export as `kebab-removebg-preview-1.png`
- Select Prawns small image → Export as `prawns-removebg-preview-1.png`
- Select Mutton small image → Export as `mutton-removebg-preview-1.png`

#### Background Images (Large food items):

### 3. Place Images
- Copy all 9 PNG files
- Paste them in: `c:\Users\Hp\OneDrive\Desktop\figma to html\`
- DO NOT put them in a subfolder - they must be in the root directory with index.html
